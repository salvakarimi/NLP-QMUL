A vector representation of a document containing lines spoken by a character in the EastEnders script data was reated.Improvements on that representation were implemented so that each character vector was maximally distinguished from the other character
documents. This distinction was measured by how well a simple information retrieval classification method could select documents from validation and test data as belonging to the correct class of document
(i.e. deciding which character spoke the lines by measuring the similarity of those character document
vectors to those built in training)
